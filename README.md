# QuadraticEquationSolver

I did this program when I was learning Python. It is pretty robust and uses different ways to solve quadratic equations.

It is a simple program which can solve any quadratic equation (with imaginary numbers). It also tries to explain the solution, by showing how to solve it step by step.

Unfortunately, everything is in Lithuanian, so you will need a translator.
